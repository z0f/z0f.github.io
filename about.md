Part-time un-paid security research, full-time web developer, part-time blogger, part-time self reflecting how I have too little time to do anything!

Any of my posts are based on my opinions and not of my employer. Blog posts will include research, opinions, tutorials, or anything that really comes to mind that involves technical shit. Basicly this blog will be like if [Coding Horror][1] went PG-13 with a dash of Rated R.

A little more about myself, I consider myself a try everything sort of person. I collect as much computer hardware, programming books, and at least try a new programming language every now and then just for kicks. And now and then I'll get interested in security side of things. I.e. learning how DDoS works from different applications, writting malware (for fun **NOT** for profit), low tech hacking.
