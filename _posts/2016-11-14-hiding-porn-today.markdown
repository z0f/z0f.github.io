Yes, this is another god damn tutorial on how to hide porn! I get it! We have the internet for this shit! So we don’t have to keep a stash of porn. But let’s admit it, people like the weirdest shit, and sometimes it’s not easy to get access to their porn all the time. Specially if it’s buried on a site like 4chan, Twitter, or some random forum no-one know’s about. Plus lots of tutorials I seen today seem extremely outdated. At least the one’s I seen on Google results… They aren’t with the times!


# 1. Using Online Storage


This may come as a surprise, but some places give a crap ton of storage for free online. Hell I even kept the [Mega][1] app on my iPhone for 2-3 months straight with my gf constantly using the phone, and she still hasn’t even accidently found my stash!


Best services for hiding porn.


- [Mega][1] (50GB)
- [Google Drive][2] (15GB)
- [Dropbox][3] (Idk)


I highly recommend Mega. You get *50GB FREE*, so you won’t have to pay anything or put in a credit card even. Google Drive isn’t bad either, but if you have a small stash Google drive maybe a good option too. No idea on rates with Dropbox, but I hear their app is pretty good. The downsides are you may need internet all the time depending on what service you go with.



# 2. Use USB Flash Drives


Flash Drives are getting cheaper and cheaper. I just picked up a 64GB for $20 bucks at Walmart. Are you kidding me? I can simply stash all the porn I want into it, hide it in the desk and never worry about it again, or even better keep it on my keychain and hide it in a bunch of folders. If someone is going through that flash drive. They ether stole my keys or I’m dead (At that point I don’t give a shit). Downside with this is you may loss your stash if you are not careful.


# 3. Use Archiving Software


Depending on the size of the stash. This will ether work for you or against you. Which is why I put this in 3rd. I will explain more later. You can use Software like [PeaZip][4] which can archive all your files/folders into one file. Which will avoid your operating system from indexing the files in the search system. Simply rename your stash archive to something like … “systemFiles.tar.gz” or take it another step, and rename the file extension to something like “.dll” or “.a”. So it would look like “someFile.dll” instead of “myPornstash.zip”.


Now when I explain the downside of this is that extracting or archiving new shit can be cumbersome. Specially if you are running older computer hardware. I.e. if you are extracting 15GB stash. Expect to get your stash 15 to 20 odd minutes depending if you are using a HDD. SDD w/ good CPU would take less time.

# 4. Use 3rd Part Bookmarking Service

May sound a little counter intuitive. But think about it. If you really want to avoid having any physical evidence of porn on your device. Online bookmarking maybe the way to go. [Delicious][5] is still around. So why not create an account using the “private mode” on your browser and simply drop links into that? Only downside is that the content needs to exist and sometimes website’s may remove images or content that’s too damn old. Be careful on who and what you bookmark!

# 5. Using The Operating System

You can use the operating system to your advantage and use special methods to hide the stash, and maybe even avoid the stuff from being indexed. So if I was you. Do Google searches on: “How do I hide files in my xyz operating system” or something to that degree. It’s simple, but effective. Downside is you must remember where everything is, and to remember to toggle certain things on and off to avoid anyone being snoopy or stumble into the stash.


# 6. Hiding In Folders In Folders

I hate this option. Don't do this unless you have a dedicated computer **YOU** only use. My Dad and myself have made this same mistake in the past. No matter what. Your operating system **WILL** index those pictures/videos you are storing. Or if you are someone like me who likes to be snoopy. Somehow or another, someone may stumble upon them the stash. You can rename shit to avoid these scenarios, but let's admit it. It's a pain in the ass, and time not worth spending.

## Thanks for Reading!

Not much of a first post, but I hope to bring more to the table. For now I wanted to get this out of the way, since I seen this answered a million times in the most laziest way.
