Today, I’m going to be talking about [Storj][1], a distributed cloud storage system. In a nutshell it sort of works like how torrent system works. Except instead of storing the whole file you are storing for someone. You only get bits and pieces (slow internet friendly), plus it’s encrypted. So you shouldn’t be getting any copyright trolls knocking on your door or your ISP suspending the internet. Plus you may actually get paid for storing the files.


This maybe a two part article on this trial and error deal I got myself into, but I would like to explain the process, and my current point of view of the hole thing. This may or may not help anyone new to Storj or bring any new light for Storj team, but let’s see how this goes.


# The Setup


First of the bat, I’m going to admit, and say that I taken the lazy approach and use the GUI for *[Storj Share][2]* for *Windows 10*. I noticed that the client uses *Node.JS* and *Python*. Which I know from experience can work for or against me. *Node.js* specially isn’t *Windows* friendly. (As far as I know.) And I didn’t want to deal with any of their bullshit, and thought the GUI would deal with that crap. Of course which it did. Depending on how things go, I may buy a *Raspberry pi* with a USB bridge with dedicated power to slap in space easily, but for now I’m using a Windows computer I’m starting to barely use at the moment, that I’ve been leaving on.


For a while I’ve been renting out 16GB. So far only 50% odd percent has been used, but get this. I randomly attach a 40MB thumbdrive and no more than 1 day later. 99% is used and the 16GB drive I attached the same day hasn't even been touched for more than a few days.


So what’s the logic going on here? Does the software prefer small drive space vs larger spaces it can literally store as much as it wants with? I’m using the latest version, last time I checked. So maybe this is intended? Or is it a bug I am only experiencing. I’ll leave it alone for a few more days and see what happens.


# Show Me THE MONEY!


I’m sure you are wondering now. Should I invest in a good SSD and computer I can depend on 24/7 to start a business out of this? I would hold the horses on this. Storj is relatively still new company, and as far as I see I haven’t even seen one 0.0001 in my wallet from them. Granted my PC did randomly decide to restart, and Storj didn’t boot backup. Which I can see why it would cause delay to see any income, plus I’ve only been renting out space for no more than a month. So this will take time. Honestly, if you want to make money not doing anything, you are better off finding a crypto currency, that’s easy to mine or has less competition over bitcoin if you want to pimp your PC out to the internet. I will add on to this later when I start seeing some numbers roll in and perhaps a little less buggy versions of the clients. For now I don’t mind helping out a small company even if it means I’m doing something for free.


# Tips and Thoughts


Make sure you setup Storj Share to automatically start, specially on Windows. The installer should have an option to do this for you IMO.
Rent out a good chunk of space to see bigger numbers. (16GB to 1TB should be good for now till this thing starts rolling)
Don’t create your online wallet in *FireFox* when you want to accept SJCX/bitcoin currency from the online wallet’s Storj Share provides. There is a bug that prevents you setting up your wallet for the first time, and I can only imagine it may cause more issues in other places.
No idea on payout dates exactly. From what I gather it’s every 2-4 weeks Storj does payouts for people renting out space.
